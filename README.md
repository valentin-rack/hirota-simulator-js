## HIROTA
**HIROTA** is a niche Japanese karate-gi manufacturer known for producing some of the finest karate uniforms in the world. 

Despite its worldwide reputation, the brand currently has **no international online store**. They remain silent in Japan.

## 🌐🛒🥋 HIROTA worldwide e-commerce simulator
This project is an **e-commerce simulator** for HIROTA built in **JavaScript**.  
The goal is to **re-imagine HIROTA as a modern international brand** while keeping the brand’s original craftsmanship and spirit intact.  

All UX/UI design and implementation are made by me — from interface layout to overall experience.

<br>

## Objectives
- Build a simple yet coherent interface aligned with HIROTA’s visual language  
- Select products from multiple categories (karate-gi, belts, equipment, etc.)  
- Configure product details (material, size, embroidery, etc.)  
- Add items to an in-memory cart  
- View a purchase summary and confirm the order

<br>

## Versions
- **HIROTA CART 1.0:** Functional shopping cart without DOM usage. All interactions rely on `prompt`, `alert`, and `confirm`.

<br>

## Technologies
- **HTML + CSS** — static UI prototype for the course  
- **JavaScript** — main logic and flow control via prompts  
- **Git / GitHub** — version control and workflow  
- **GitHub Pages** — live deployment
